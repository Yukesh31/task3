1)
    var obj = [
          { person: "Name 1", age: "2", company: "GUVI" },
          { person: "Name 2", age: "5", company: "GUVI geek" },
          { person: "Name 3", age: "8", company: "GUVI geek network" },
        ]
    use the above JSON to iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)

solution:

for loop;-
var obj = [
{ person: "Rahul", age: "2", company: "GUVI" },
{ person: "Rohit", age: "5", company: "GUVI geek" },
{ person: "Rakesh", age: "8", company: "GUVI geek network" },
]
for(let i =0;i<obj.length;i++)
{
console.log(obj[i]);
}
for of loop:-
var obj = [
{ person: "Rahul", age: "2", company: "GUVI" },
{ person: "Rohit", age: "5", company: "GUVI geek" },
{ person: "Rakesh", age: "8", company: "GUVI geek network" },
]
for(var property of obj)
{
console.log(property);
}
for in loop:-
var obj = [
{ person: "Rahul", age: "2", company: "GUVI" },
{ person: "Rohit", age: "5", company: "GUVI geek" },
{ person: "Rakesh", age: "8", company: "GUVI geek network" },
]
for(var property in obj)
{
console.log(obj[property]);
}
for each loop:-
var obj = [
{ person: "Rahul", age: "2", company: "GUVI" },
{ person: "Rohit", age: "5", company: "GUVI geek" },
{ person: "Rakesh", age: "8", company: "GUVI geek network" },
]
obj.forEach(key => console.log(key))

3)Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript
Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, 
and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name 
The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser.
Each window object has a document object to be rendered
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
screen describes the physical display's full screen
he window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
screen properties width and height are the full screen
screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
**The window is the actual global object.
**The screen is the screen, it contains properties about the user's display.
**The document is where the DOM is.
